## Description

Workify provides a platform for users to create project groups, add their team members and assign work to the team members of the project. It also keeps track of these tasks whether they're completed or not before the due date provided.We have a notification feature which notifies users on project creation and also when work is assigned to a team member via mail. It helps users to manage and do their project submissions on time with a user friendly interface.
